Data Set description from original source:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.




## Details of operations on data

As per project instructions, the final tidy data set must contain only the mean and standard deviation of measurments. The data has to be averaged for each  activity and each subject. 

* Load the entire dataset the feature names and the acivity list into R. Since data is divided into test and train datasets, load both in seperately.
* Merge the dataset joining the test data, the train data their labels and subject lists. This gives a large data frame on which the remaining operatins are to be performed.
* Extract measurments of mean and standard deviation. The names of each colum specify if they are measurments of mean or std dev. 
* Clean the variable names. 
* Use descriptive activity names. Merge the activity names data frame loded from the activity list file into the data using the activity column.
* Average by each activity and subject. Aggregate over activity and subject and find the mean for each variable.
* Write to output file
